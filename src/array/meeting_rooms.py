"""

The "Meeting Rooms" problem is about determining if a person can attend all their meetings without overlap. Given an
array of intervals where each interval represents a meeting time [start, end], the goal is to check if any of these
intervals overlap. If thereâ€™s overlap, return False; otherwise, return True.

For example:

Input: [[0, 30], [5, 10], [15, 20]]
Output: False (since the meetings overlap).
